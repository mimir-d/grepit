GREPIT 9 workshop
===============

Participants were required to write an AI module for a simple simulation in which:

* there is a feeder object in the middle giving life per second to anyone in range
* there is food scattered in the playing field giving an absolute amount of life on pickup
* players colliding with one another lose life per second

The score system and results are in the scores.md file.

### Requirements

* python 3.x

### Install notes

* install pip and run: pip install -r requirements.txt
* run with: python ants.py (will create an entity for each player module in ai directory)
