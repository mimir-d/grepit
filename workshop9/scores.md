## Rules:

1. scoring is awarded as follows:
    1. players that die during the round get increasingly more points in the order in which they died.
    2. players that are still alive at end of round get equal amount of points if their health
        at the time wasn't accounted for, otherwise get increasingly more points as they have more
        health
    3. points are cummulative with each round
2. the player with most points after end of rounds wins
